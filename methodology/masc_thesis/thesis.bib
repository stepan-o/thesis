These are data collected from mobile sensors carried by individuals, data derived from businesses moving their activity online and government data released in an open format. Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers. Existing projects and initiatives that conform to each class are featured as illustrative examples of these new potential sources of knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@unpublished{Batty2008,
abstract = {Cities have been treated as systems for fifty year but only in the last two decades has the focus changed from aggregate equilibrium systems to more evolving systems whose structure merges from the bottom up. We first outline the rudiments of the traditional approach focusing on equilibrium and then discuss how the paradigm has changed to one which treats cities as emergent phenomena generated through a combination of hierarchical levels of decision, driven in decentralized fashion. This is consistent with the complexity sciences which dominate the simulation of urban form and function. We begin however with a review of equilibrium models, particularly those based on spatial interaction, and we then explore how simple dynamic frameworks can be fashioned to generate more realistic models. In exploring dynamics, nonlinear systems which admit chaos and bifurcation have relevance but recently more pragmatic schemes of structuring urban models based on cellular automata and agent-based modeling principles have come to the fore. Most urban models deal with the city in terms of the location of its economic and demographic activities but there is also a move to link such models to urban morphologies which are clearly fractal in structure. Throughout this chapter, we show how key concepts in complexity such as scaling, self-similarity and far-from-equilibrium structures dominate our current treatment of cities, how we might simulate their functioning and how we might predict their futures. We conclude with the key problems that dominate the field and suggest how these might be tackled in future research. †in},

abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

The 1948 survey provided comprehensive data to analyze the forecasts made by the calibrated model. The gr avity model will give satisfactory results if properly calibrated and tested.

Researchers in these two fields work with different datasets, apply different methodologies, and answer different but overlapping questions. It is our view that there is much, hidden synergy between the two fields that needs to be brought out. It is thus the purpose of this paper to introduce datasets, concepts, knowledge and methods used in these two fields, and most importantly raise cross-discipline ideas for conversations and collaborations between the two.

There is, in the twenty-first century, an intense interest in the nature of wicked problems and the complex tasks of identifying their scope, viable responses, and appropriate mechanisms and pathways towards achieving improvement. This preoccupation is timeless, but the discussion over several decades has benefited from Rittel and Webber's (Policy Sci 4(2):155–169, 1973) path breaking conceptualisation of wicked problems and the political argumentation needed to resolve them. This review revisits Rittel and Webber's work and its enduring significance, reflecting upon its broad uptake and impact in the policy sciences, an impact that continues to grow over time. We revisit how the classic 1973 paper came to be published in Policy Sciences, its innovative depiction of social problems, its rejection of rationalistic design, its acknowledgement of the subjectivities involved in problem identification and resolutions, and the consequent need for argumentative-based solution processes. We find great resonance in the paper with contemporary problem solving preoccupations, not least that the political context is crucial, that argumentation must be transparent and robust, and that policy interventions may have consequences that cannot be easily controlled in open and highly pluralised social systems.},

The intention is also to compare the current state of practice with what might be the ideal in various respects. The six frameworks reviewed (ITLUP, MEPLAN, TRANUS, MUSSA, NYMTC-LUM and UrbanSim) are considered in terms of their representations of physical systems, decision-makers and processes, along with various more general modelling and implementation issues. None matches the ideal as envisaged here in all respects. However, a wide range of policy considerations can be handled explicitly with what is available, and more recent developments show an encouraging trend towards expansion in the scope of what can be considered. Further strengthening of the behavioural basis and relaxation of some of the more restrictive assumptions would appear to be both appropriate and likely in the future.},

Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.},

IUMs have been criticized over this same period on both practical and theoretical grounds. At the same time, continuing and very significant technological developments have made possible the development, implementation and use of such models in operational planning settings in various countries worldwide. A major review of the IUM state of the art and recommendations for evolution of this state were prepared by the author and colleagues 20 years ago. This paper presents an update of the 1998 report in terms of a summary of progress over the past 20 years, a critical assessment of the current IUM state of the art and practice, and needs and prospects for future development. This paper argues that the current modeling state is in “the doldrums,” similar to concerns raised by Pas in the seminal 1990 critique of activity-based travel models. It then outlines research and development needs to exploit current and emerging data, computing, and methodological developments that hold promise for the development of a much more powerful and useful “next generation” of IUMs.},

The need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special Report 213—Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published in 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Urban Project H-12 FY'96 ISSN 1073-4872 ISBN 0-309-06324-8 Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 99-71031 . 1999 Transportation Research Board Price {\$}22.00ID - 1535},

abstract = {Traditionally, integrated land-use/transportation models intend to represent all opportunities of travel and household location, maximize utilities and find an equilibrium in which no person or household could improve their satisfaction any further. Energy scarcity, higher transportation costs, and an increasing share of low-income households, on the other hand, demand special attention to represent constraints that households face, rather than opportunities for utility maximization. The integrated land-use model SILO explicitly represents various constraints, including the price of a dwelling, the travel time to work, and the monetary transportation budget. SILO ensures that no household makes choices that violate these constraints. Implementing such constraints helps SILO to generate more realistic results under scenarios that put current conditions under a stress test, such as a serious increase in transportation costs or severely increased congestion.},

abstract = {Public actors and, in general, public service providers - such as municipalities, provinces and agencies - play a major role in achieving a satisfying quality of life for citizens. The social context in which these institutions operate is intrinsically complex. This complexity arises from the different expectations of the community (pluralism). It also arises from the plurality of actors involved in policy-making (institutional complexity) and from the interplays of several factors, such as those related to technical, economic and environmental dimensions (scientific uncertainty) (Head {\&} Alford, 2013). The above characteristics determine what literature defines as ‘wicked' problems (Rittel {\&} Webber, 1973). The term ‘wicked' does not means ‘evil', but refers to issues that are hard to define and manage, due to the high complexity of the environment which they affect (Australian Public Service Commission, 2007; Head {\&} Alford, 2013). These issues often lead to counterintuitive behaviours in terms of time (trade-off between short- and long-term) and space (trade-off between different institutions or functional areas within an organization) when actions are taken to resolve them. Institutional complexity, pluralism and scientific uncertainty typically characterize the provision of public services, for this reason, many issues that Public Administrations (PA) have to deal with, can be considered wicked.},

abstract = {This paper briefly reviews the inexorable rise of the social exclusion policy paradigm and uses an adaptation of Amartya Sen's theory of entitlement to determine appropriate policy responses. In particular, the promotion by the UK Department for Transport of accessibility planning is examined. Although this initiative is not totally without merit, the resulting analysis may be too aggregate, both spatially and socially. The weakness of such an approach is that transport-related social exclusion is not always a socially and spatially concentrated process. Instead we suggest a matrix of area accessibility, area mobility and individual mobility as a possible schema for identifying concentrated and scattered manifestations of social exclusion and inclusion and for suggesting appropriate policy responses. This schema helps produce a more spatially and socially differentiated conceptualisation of social exclusion, helps identify policy responses and most critically highlights that the problems of the socially excluded immobile should not be analysed in isolation from the socially included mobile. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

This model encourages best practices and offers organizations the structure needed to realize better, faster results from data mining. CRISP-DM organizes the data mining process into six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. These phases help organizations understand the data mining process and provide a road map to follow while planning and carrying out a data mining project. This article explores all six phases, including the tasks involved with each phase.

abstract = {This article reviews empirical studies of the relationship between transportation facilities—highways, heavy rail, and light rail transit systems—and property values. The main objective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities.},

In 1985, the Government of Ontario initiated the Province of Ontario Land Registration Information System (POLARIS) pilot project for the purposes of records automation and the conversion from the Registry System to the Land Titles System. The Land Registration Reform Act (Ontario) was introduced to facilitate electronic search and registration of properties and the automation of paper-based records. POLARIS was built by the Province to house and process electronic land records. Teranet converted all qualified Registry properties in Ontario to the Land Titles system and automated existing paper Land Titles parcels. As a result, 99.9{\%} of property in Ontario is parcelized and administered under the Land Titles system, which affords a property ownership guarantee by the province.},

Land use and transportation have a long and complex history of influencing one another, and this relationship has been studied through many dimensions over the past hundred years. The role of land use and transportation researchers has been, and still is, to develop precisely measured, relevant, and reflective research that can help transport and planning professionals design effective policies and plans. While researchers in this domain often conduct studies that lead to changes in planning practice, their areas of research focus are constantly evolving and frequently influenced by the technologies, policies, and implementation of particular approaches to planning within a given context and time. The relationship between land use and transportation research and practice is therefore cyclical: practice is informed by research, and research interests stem from practical issues and trends.},
