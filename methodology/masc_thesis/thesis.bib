abstract = {Offering the tools needed to evaluate trends and understand key factors affecting the real estate market, this book explains how to get started, where to get information, and how to apply the basic techniques to a variety of development types. This practical primer offers a step-by-step approach to developing property—whether public or private sector—and shows how market-analysis methods have been employed in real projects. The 13 case studies written by top market analysts provide models that can be applied to multifamily, hotel, office, industrial, entertainment, mixed-use, and/or master-planned communities. This is an excellent reference for real estate students and professionals to maximize potential in a troubled market.},

abstract = {Historically, searching titles in Ontario was a complicated and time consuming activity. Each search required a personal visit to a Land Registry Office to view paper indexes, original documents and plans. In 1985, the Government of Ontario initiated the Province of Ontario Land Registration Information System (POLARIS) pilot project for the purposes of records automation and the conversion from the Registry System to the Land Titles System. The Land Registration Reform Act (Ontario) was introduced to facilitate electronic search and registration of properties and the automation of paper-based records. POLARIS was built by the Province to house and process electronic land records. Teranet converted all qualified Registry properties in Ontario to the Land Titles system and automated existing paper Land Titles parcels. As a result, 99.9{\%} of property in Ontario is parcelized and administered under the Land Titles system, which affords a property ownership guarantee by the province.},

@book{Jacobs1961a,
abstract = {The Death and Life of Great American Cities is a 1961 book by writer and activist Jane Jacobs. The book is a critique of 1950s urban planning policy, which it holds responsible for the decline of many city neighborhoods in the United States. The book is Jacobs' best-known and most influential work. Jacobs was a critic of "rationalist" planners of the 1950s and 1960s, especially Robert Moses, as well as the earlier work of Le Corbusier. She argued that modernist urban planning overlooked and oversimplified the complexity of human lives in diverse communities. She opposed large-scale urban renewal programs that affected entire neighborhoods and built freeways through inner cities. She instead advocated for dense mixed use development and walkable streets, with the "eyes on the street" of passers-by helping to maintain public order.},

@article{Shearer2000,
abstract = {This article describes CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), a non-proprietary, documented, and freely available data mining model. Developed by industry leaders with input from more than 200 data mining users and data mining tool and service providers, CRISP-DM is an industry-, tool-, and application-neutral model. This model encourages best practices and offers organizations the structure needed to realize better, faster results from data mining. CRISP-DM organizes the data mining process into six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. These phases help organizations understand the data mining process and provide a road map to follow while planning and carrying out a data mining project. This article explores all six phases, including the tasks involved with each phase. Sidebar material, which takes a look at specific data mining problem types and techniques for addressing them, is provided.},

@article{Crowley2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. There is, in the twenty-first century, an intense interest in the nature of wicked problems and the complex tasks of identifying their scope, viable responses, and appropriate mechanisms and pathways towards achieving improvement. This preoccupation is timeless, but the discussion over several decades has benefited from Rittel and Webber's (Policy Sci 4(2):155–169, 1973) path breaking conceptualisation of wicked problems and the political argumentation needed to resolve them. This review revisits Rittel and Webber's work and its enduring significance, reflecting upon its broad uptake and impact in the policy sciences, an impact that continues to grow over time. We revisit how the classic 1973 paper came to be published in Policy Sciences, its innovative depiction of social problems, its rejection of rationalistic design, its acknowledgement of the subjectivities involved in problem identification and resolutions, and the consequent need for argumentative-based solution processes. We find great resonance in the paper with contemporary problem solving preoccupations, not least that the political context is crucial, that argumentation must be transparent and robust, and that policy interventions may have consequences that cannot be easily controlled in open and highly pluralised social systems.},

abstract = {The search for sceintific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail, because of the nature of these problems. They are "wicked" problems, whereas science has developed to deal with "tame" problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to social problems inless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no "solutions" in the sense of definitive and objective answers.},

abstract = {In this paper, I review the recent emergence of three groups of data sources and assess some of the opportunities and challenges they pose for the understanding of cities, particularly in the context of the Regional Science and urban research agenda. These are data collected from mobile sensors carried by individuals, data derived from businesses moving their activity online and government data released in an open format. Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers. Existing projects and initiatives that conform to each class are featured as illustrative examples of these new potential sources of knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
