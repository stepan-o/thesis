An increasing amount of aspects of human life can be traced back through diverse digital footprints and, when aggregated, can reveal emerging patterns.\cite{Arribas-Bel2014}
As such forms of human activity as transactions of land and real estate ownership become digitized\cite{TeranetEnterprisesInc.}, a wealth of data becomes captured and available for analysis.
These increasingly comprehensive archives of human behaviour, combined with the exponential growth of computational power, create potential for transformations in such fields as sociology\cite{Lazer2017} and travel behaviour analysis\cite{Chen2016}.

However, when it comes to using these data sources in social studies, along with opportunities there are also challenges present.
For example, these data sources can have issues with the quality of the data, might require a specific set of skills to take advantage of these data sources, or might not be suitable for traditional methods meant for traditional data\cite{Arribas-Bel2014}.
In addition, when it comes to interpreting real estate market dynamics, drawing conclusions from data can be more of an art than a science.\cite{Brett2009}
Therefore, to study the interaction between land development, urban form, and transportation, it would be beneficial to have a system that can facilitate efficient access to linked information describing these phenomena to researchers from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds.

The study of complex systems, including urban systems such as land development or transportation, is intrinsically tied to modelling and computation.
Various computer-based models allow us to explore and improve our understanding of the behaviour of a complex system.
Thus, systematic analysis and modelling of urban systems intrinsically depends on our ability to represent and model urban regions and urban processes, which in turn is often limited by our computing software and hardware capabilities.

With large amounts of information about urban regions digitalized\cite{TeranetEnterprisesInc.}, computer-based data storage and data display, manipulation, and management systems, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), nowadays play an increasingly important role.
These systems become important because they offer researchers easy access to a wide array of diverse data sources and allow efficient workflows to prepare datasets to be used in statistical analysis software, modelling software, machine learning, etc.

Bourne\cite{Bourne1982} defines urban structure as the combination of the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item urban form, or the spatial configuration of fixed elements within the urban region (including land use, buildings, transportation network, etc.)
    \item urban interactions, or the flows of goods, people, information, and money (including commercial activity, real estate market, etc.)
    \item organizing principles, or the relationships between the urban form and interactions (such as travel cost minimization, social status, segregation, planning policy, etc.)
\end{itemize}


One of the possible ways of studying the interaction between the housing market, urban form, and transportation is empirical, such as examining how property values vary with the distance to a transportation facility\cite{Sherry1999}.
However, this type of research requires fine-scale transportation data to be linked to fine-scale housing market data, which presents a challenge since these data sources use different spatial units (as discussed in section~\ref{sec:spatial_relationships}) and are available at different temporal spans (as discussed in section~\ref{sec:termporal_relationships_between_datasets}).
The primary focus of this mater's thesis is the introduction of a knowledge system providing researchers at the University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute (UTTRI) access to the information required to investigate the complex relationship between transportation and land use.
