The title of the post was “A Taxonomy of Data Science” on the now defunct dataists blog. This process has also been used as the structure of a recent book, specifically “Data Science at the Command Line: Facing the Future with Time-Tested Tools” by Jeroen Janssens published by O'Reilly. In this post we take a closer look at the OSEMN process for working through a data problem.},

@misc{Mason2010,
    abstract = {Both within the academy and within tech startups, we've been hearing some similar questions lately: Where can I find a good data scientist? What do I need to learn to become a data scientist? Or more succinctly: What is data science? We've variously heard it said that data science requires some command-line fu for data procurement and preprocessing, or that one needs to know some machine learning or stats, or that one should know how to `look at data'. All of these are partially true, so we thought it would be useful to propose one possible taxonomy — we call it the Snice* taxonomy — of what a data scientist does, in roughly chronological order: Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret (or, if you like, OSEMN, which rhymes with possum). Different data scientists have different levels of expertise with each of these 5 areas, but ideally a data scientist should be at home with them all. In this post, we describe each one of these steps briefly.},

    abstract = {This hands-on guide demonstrates how the flexibility of the command line can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. You'll learn how to combine small, yet powerful, command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your data. To get you started—whether you're on Windows, OS X, or Linux—author Jeroen Janssens has developed the Data Science Toolbox, an easy-to- install virtual environment packed with over 80 command-line tools. Discover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible technology. Even if you're already comfortable processing data with, say, Python or R, you'll greatly improve your data science workflow by also leveraging the power of the command line.},
