abstract = {You have already used SQL for querying data from databases. But did you actually know that there's a whole lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data â€“ and relationships between them. This gives your data structure as well as consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life data set that was used to investigate questionable affiliations of universities. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. In between, you'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships as well as how to enforce data integrity. Also, you'll discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints.},
